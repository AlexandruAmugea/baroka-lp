                  <h5>2. Accounts</h5>
              </a>
            </div>
            <h2>Why should I enter my email?</h2>

            <p>We consider email to be an unique identificator, which will be used for every login into your Buroka Account,
              alongside with your private password, and if activated with 2 factor authenticator (2FA).</p>

            <h2>What is the 2-factor authentication?</h2>

            <p>Two Factor Authentication, also known as 2FA, two step verification or TFA (as an acronym), is an extra layer
              of security that is known as "multi factor authentication" that requires not only a password and username but
              also something that only, and only, that user has on them, i.e. a piece of information only they should know
              or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token. Using a username and password together with a piece
              of information that only the user knows makes it harder for potential intruders to gain access and steal that
              person's personal data or identity.</p>

            <h2>How do I delete my account?</h2>

            <p>If you at any point in time would like to delete your Buroka account, you should send an email to support@buroka.com,
              asking for the deletion of the account, and the reason for which you want your account to be closed/deleted.

            </div>
            <h2>What's a bitcoin wallet ?</h2>

            <p>A Bitcoin wallet is also referred to as a digital Wallet. Establishing such a wallet is an important step in
              the process of obtaining Bitcoins. Just as Bitcoins are the digital equivalent of cash, a Bitcoin wallet is
              analogous to a physical wallet. But instead of storing Bitcoins literally, what is stored is a lot of relevant
              information like the secure private key used to access Bitcoin addresses and carry out transactions. The four
              main types of wallet are desktop, mobile, web and hardware. At Buroka, we store your Bitcoin for you in our
              segregated wallets. You will have access at any point in time to your bitcoin in order to withdraw them to
              your personal wallet. Withdrawals are accepted only to your personal wallet, and Buroka will not be responsible
              for what might happen for withdrawing to third party wallets.</p>

            <h2>What is a hash?</h2>

            <p>A hash algorithm turns an arbitrarily-large amount of data into a fixed-length hash. The same hash will always
              result from the same data, but modifying the data by even one bit will completely change the hash. Like all
              computer data, hashes are large numbers, and are usually written as hexadecimal. BitCoin uses the SHA-256 hash
              algorithm to generate verifiably "random" numbers in a way that requires a predictable amount of CPU effort.
              Generating a SHA-256 hash with a value less than the current target solves a block and wins you some coins.</p>

            <h2>How do I buy bitcoin on Buroka?</h2>

            <p>BUY BITCOIN IN 3 EASY STEPS</p>

            <p>1.</p>
            <p>Sign up for free on Buroka and verify<br> your account with our easy setup process.</p>

            <p>2. </p>
            <p>Fund your account with your local currency,<br> you can do that by direct deposit, local<br> bank transfer or
              credit card. </p>

            <p>3. </p>
            <p>Buy Bitcoin instantly and store it with our secure<br> BitGo wallets or transfer it to your personal wallet<br>              of choice.</p>

            <h2>What is the maximal/minimal amount that can be exchanged?</h2>

            <p>On Buroka, you can exchange a minimum of 0.01 BTC, and a minimum of 0.1 ETH. There is no maximum amount limitation.
              </p>

            <h2>What is the maximal/minimal amount that can be deposited?</h2>

            <p>The minimal amount that can be deposited in Buroka wallet is of $50, or equivalent in local currency. There are
              no minimal requirements on cryptocurrency deposits.</p>

            <h2>What are network fees?</h2>

            <p>The transaction fee is received by the bitcoin miner. When a new bitcoin block is generated with a successful
              hash, the information for all of the transactions is included with the block and all transaction fees are collected
              by that miner creating the block, who is free to assign those fees to himself. Traditionally, the sender pays
              the full Bitcoin network fee; deducting the fee from the amount received by the recipient will often be considered
              an incomplete payment, although some wallets have a "sender-pays-fee" feature where the miner fee is deduced
              from send amount.</p>

            <h2>How do I cancel my exchange transaction?</h2>

            <p>Once an exchange transaction is made through Buroka, it cannot be canceled. After approving the exchange, your
              wallet will be instantly credited with the cryptocurrency, or fiat, based on the direction of your exchange,
              and this operation cannot be canceled.</p>

            <h2>Why does my Bitcoin withdrawal take so long?</h2>

            <p>Whenever you send someone Bitcoins, the transaction goes through different computers running the Bitcoin protocol
              around the world that make sure the transaction is valid. Once the transaction is verified it then “waits”
              inside the Mempool (i.e. in some sort of a “limbo” state). It’s basically waiting to be picked up by a Bitcoin
              miner and entered into a block of transaction on the Blockchain. Until it is picked up it’s considered an “unconfirmed
              transaction” or a “pending transaction”.</p>

            <p>A new block of transactions in added to the Blockchain every 10 minutes on average. However since there are so
              many transactions lately due to the price increase, and a block can only hold a finite amount of transactions,
              not all transactions are picked instantly. So you need to wait for a certain amount of time until a miner decided
              to pick your transaction out of all of those sitting around in the mempool.</p>
